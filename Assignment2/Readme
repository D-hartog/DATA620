# DATA 620 Web Analytics
# Assignment 2 - Graph Visualization
**Gillian McGovern, Dhanya Nair, Dirk Hartog**

Instructions: 

Load a graph database of your choosing from a text file or other source.  If you take a large network dataset from the web (such as from Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection), please feel free at this point to load just a small subset of the nodes and edges.

Create basic analysis on the graph, including 
the graphâ€™s diameter, and at least one other metric of your choosing.  

You may either code the functions by hand (to build your intuition and insight), or use functions in an existing package. 

Use a visualization tool of your choice to display information. 
Use NetworkX directly, pyviz or another tool (Gephi or 
Neo4j) but you should get used to using the Python toolset. 

Please record a short video (~ 5 minutes), and submit a link to the video in advance of our meet-up. You will be showing your assignment in the meet-up but it is always useful to have a recording.
